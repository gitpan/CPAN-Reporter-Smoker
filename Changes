0.05 Tue Feb 26 22:56:12 EST 2008

    - Smoker now periodically checks for new distributions; added

    - Added support for CPAN cache scanning on start and at each restart (if
      configured in CPAN::Config)
    
    - Changed invocation of CPAN so trust_test_report_history option will work

    - Skips Bundles and mod_perl

    - Quick fix of broken distribution (added missing prereq and restored
      a private function that was mistakenly deleted)

0.03 Mon Feb  4 11:23:43 EST 2008

    - Vastly improved logic for selecting distributions to test
