TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Bugs

# High priority

- bring in CPAN::Reporter t/*.t support to actually test functionality

- create a minicpan in the t/ directory for testing
    - will need to figure out about alpha modules as well

# Medium priority

- use CPAN::Reporter's send_skipfile before even trying to test 
   - or use own custom one?
   - or use distroprefs?  skip even things in dependencies?

- check recent files as well to pick up new developer versions
    - parse CPAN/RECENT file for alpha versions and stick them at the 
      front of the queue
    - possibly don't put them in the queue if we can tell they've been
      tested, but this wouldn't be a lazy check the way the rest is, so
      maybe just skip it

- break out of test loop and recheck for updates after some period of delay

- retest discards after some period of time
    - or after failing deps are updated -- but how to discover what these are?
      would need changes to CPAN::Reporter history logging to separately
      log DISCARD with the missing dependencies

# Low/Maybe

- try Parse::CPAN::Meta as a way of getting dependencies?

- find a way to clear CPAN programmatically instead of running in a subshell
  or else find a way to patch CPAN's set_perl5lib to restrict to only
  the necessary distributions
