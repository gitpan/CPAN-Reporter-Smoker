TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Bugs

# High priority

- bring in CPAN::Reporter t/*.t support to actually test functionality

- create a minicpan in the t/ directory for testing
    - will need to figure out about alpha modules as well

# Medium priority

- use CPAN::Reporter's send_skipfile before even trying to test 
   - or use own custom one?
   - or use distroprefs?  skip even things in dependencies?

- break out of test loop and recheck for updates after some period of delay

- retest discards after some period of time
    - or after failing deps are updated -- but how to discover what these are?
      would need changes to CPAN::Reporter history logging to separately
      log DISCARD with the missing dependencies

- statistics -- show counter of tests for each test run; show total tests 
  run at the end

# Low/Maybe

- add some process control -- keep a proces ID in a run file and add a stop()
  commnd to stop a running process.

- try Parse::CPAN::Meta as a way of getting dependencies?

- find a way to clear CPAN programmatically instead of running in a subshell
  or else find a way to patch CPAN's set_perl5lib to restrict to only
  the necessary distributions
