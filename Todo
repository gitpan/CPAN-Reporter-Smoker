# High priority

# Medium priority

- use CPAN::Reporter's send_skipfile before even trying to test 
   - or use own custom one?
   - or use distroprefs?  skip even things in dependencies?

- create old alpha modules for minicpan and confirm they *aren't* tested
    - edit file-ls.gz

- retest discards after some period of time
    - or after failing deps are updated -- but how to discover what these are?
      would need changes to CPAN::Reporter history logging to separately
      log DISCARD with the missing dependencies

- on CTRL-C, if CPAN has distroprefs, offer to auto-disable the current distro

- dependencies
    - look at Module::Depends::Intrusive and CPAN::Unwind

- eventually, test and mention 'halt_on_failure' config option to shortcut
  when a dependency fails (though this misses where dependency upgrade fails
  and yet module succeeds)

- statistics -- show counter of tests for each test run; show total tests 
  run at the end

# Low/Maybe

- logging STDERR to a file -- parameter to start()?

- add some process control -- keep a proces ID in a run file and add a stop()
  commnd to stop a running process.

- try Parse::CPAN::Meta as a way of getting dependencies?

- find a way to clear CPAN programmatically instead of running in a subshell
  or else find a way to patch CPAN's set_perl5lib to restrict to only
  the necessary distributions
