# High priority

- add option to write dist being smoked to a file

# Medium priority

- if interrupted,  be more helpful
    - offer to send email to bug-Dist-Name@rt.cpan.org? (use Net::SMTP and
      CPAN::Reporter mail host?)
    - if CPAN has distroprefs, offer to auto-disable the current distro, or
      at least to open distroprefs in editor?
    
- retest discards after some period of time
    - would need CPAN::Reporter::History to keep timestamp
    - or after failing deps are updated -- but how to discover what these are?
      would need changes to CPAN::Reporter history logging to separately
      log DISCARD with the missing dependencies
    - but halt_on_failure prevents a DISCARD message, so then what?  
      Maybe this does need to be logged via CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Low/Maybe

- docs: suggest that they join cpan-testers-discuss mailing list

- docs: document how to disable CPANPLUS

- create old alpha modules for minicpan and confirm they *aren't* tested
    - edit file-ls.gz

- dependencies
    - look at Module::Depends::Intrusive and CPAN::Unwind

- statistics -- show counter of tests for each test run; show total tests 
  run at the end

- logging STDERR to a file -- parameter to start()?

- add some process control -- keep a proces ID in a run file and add a stop()
  commnd to stop a running process.

- try Parse::CPAN::Meta as a way of getting dependencies?
